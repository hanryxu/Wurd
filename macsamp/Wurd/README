wurd is the executable program.  We're providing a dictionary with about
110,000 words.  If you want to try running with a smaller dictionary,
rename our big dictionary.txt to something else, and copy your smaller
dictionary to dictionary.txt.  Alternatively, you can load a new
dictionary into the editor with the CTRL-D command.

You can run the command
	wurd
to start editing with an empty file, or
	wurd someFileName
to start editing the named file.  In either case, if in the same directory
as the wurd program there is a file named dictionary.txt, it will be used
as the dictionary.

We're also providing some text files to edit of various sizes:
civildis.txt (1KB), threemen.txt (382KB), and warandpeace.txt (3.3MB).  If
you run wurd from the command line, you can give the file to edit as an
argument.  Otherwise, you can load the file with the Ctrl-L command in the
editor.
